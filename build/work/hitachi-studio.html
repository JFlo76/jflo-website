				<h2>Bringing IT to OT</h2>
				<p>Hitachi’s Lumada Studio is the user interface for the data collected and analyzed on the Lumada Core
					platform, and is primarily used by people in the manufacturing industry to monitor production for
					predictive maintenance.</p>
				<p>The goals for this application included an intuitive interface, data visualization through
					customizable dashboards, a library of widgets for the charts/graphs, and the ability to generate
					reports.</p>

				<h1>User Research</h1>
				<p>Before starting any designs, I needed to fully understand the user profiles for a manufacturing
					plant. I sought out a few Hitachi OT specialists to gain insight on who would be using this
					application and what they typically do in their day. After a couple of meetings and sleuthing
					through Confluence documentation, I discovered there were essentially 3 types of user roles:</p>

						architect at Hitachi Consulting. He works closely with customers to deploy and configure Studio
						according to their requirements. He needs to have full access to all aspects of Studio to
						fulfill his job. Adam has the technical acumen to understand the intricacies of the technologies
						behind Studio and how to customize it. He also has a strong understanding of all the different
						Lumada products.</p>

				<h1>Customizing the Experience</h1>
				<p>In order to help the user get started, I wanted to provide a few dashboard templates that he could
					use to help the user do their job. Basing each view off the main job duties for each user, I
					proposed 3 levels: Regional, Factory, and Asset level views.</p>

				<h1>A Flexible Navigation System</h1>
				<p>Since the Studio could potentially be used by any industry that wants to collect and visualize data
					coming from machine sensors, the dashboards needed to be customizable for each client. Our team of
					engineers chose the open-source project Superset, by Airbnb, to enable a Hitachi consultant (Admin
					Adam) to configure any arrangement of business intelligence widgets, scoped to an individual user if
					needed. This level of customization meant that the navigation would be dead simple.<br />I love dead
					simple.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="w-100"></div>
			<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
				<p>The navigation pattern I envisioned for this application followed a mobile-first approach, where the
					user simply drills down by interacting with elements in the dashboard. To move back, the user can
					click/tap the “back arrow”, which takes the user back up one level, or the “home” icon which jumps
					them back to the top level. When the user is drilled to a child level that has siblings, the level
					name would also be a dropdown that allows the user to move laterally between siblings.</p>

				<p>Based on feedback from design reviews and a usability test, I brought in a little more navigation
					redundancy in the form of multiple breadcrumbs, instead of a single parent breadcrumb.</p>

				<h1>Data Visualizations</h1>
				<p>One of the really cool things about the Hitachi Lumada suite of products is that it allows developers
					to create their own solutions for data visualization. But we couldn't go to market without providing

				<h1>Next Steps...</h1>
				<p>As of the time of this writing, the Lumada Studio team of engineers are building out the platform and
					I have been playing a supporting role to them by writing the HTML &amp; CSS and ensuring the actual
					product is to the specs of the design.</p>
				<p>Once built, I plan to perform some more usability testing and iterating based on feedback.</p>
