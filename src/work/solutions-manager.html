				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Hitachi's Solutions Manager application was conceived and designed by some of my teammates, with the
					purpose of allowing a power-user with admin privileges to manage customized dashboards, or
					"Solutions" and the elements that go into building them.</p>
				<p>After the GA version was released, I wanted to perform an evaluation of the application, propose
					theories for improvements, and conduct usability sessions in order to test those theories.</p>

				<h2>Some Background...</h2>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">There are 3 types of components in the application:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Template, which can be thought of as a recipe for a configurable dashboard widget</li>
					<li>Instance, which is the configured widget created from the Template</li>
					<li>Dashboard, which is, well... a dashboard that contains a number of Instances</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">The basic workflow:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>User logs in</li>
					<li>User uploads a Template</li>
					<li>User deploys an Instance from a Template to a new or existing Dashboard</li>
					<li>After successful deployment, the user then will see a new Instance of the Template, and the
						Dashboard within their inventory</li>
				</ol>

				<h1>Test Summary</h1>
				<p class="font-weight-bold">The test objectives were as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Improve user's mental mappings between the components</li>
					<li>Improve ease of use for navigating between the associated components</li>
					<!-- 						<li>Preference testing for default layout of inventory (grid vs row), and how application metrics are presented in the UI</li> -->
				</ol>
				<p>Myself and 2 other team members ran a series of 5 remote individual in-depth interviews, each of us
					taking turns conducting with a written script and taking notes.</p>
				<p>The participants were all Hitachi consultants, solutions architects and engineers with OT skill sets,
					which aligns with the persona "Admin Adam" for this application.</p>
				<p>Each participant joined via video conference where we had them share their computer screen. I used
					the online tool CanvasFlip in order to record the user's clicks and workflow through the prototype
					that I designed using Sketch, while my teammate would take notes and record the audio.</p>

				<h1>Objective 1: Mental Mappings</h1>
				<h2>Existing problem:</h2>
				<p>In the GA release UI, there was no clear connection between a Template and the Instances that were
					created from it. The UI had them separated on different pages, with no indication of which Instances
					were deployed from a certain Template. Likewise, there was no indication to show which Dashboard an
					Instance was deployed to, and which & how many Instances a Dashboard contains.</p>
				<img src="/img/projects/solutions-manager/original-templates-grid.jpg"
					srcset="/img/projects/solutions-manager/original-templates-grid@2x.jpg 2x">
				<h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
				<p>For visualizing the associations between Template and Instance(s), I decided to alter the card view
					so that each card showed a nested list of Instances that were spawned from that particular Template.
					I also added some search inputs for Templates and Instances scoped to a Template, as well as more
					text for the sorting so users would immediately know the sorting status.</p>
				<img src="/img/projects/solutions-manager/new-templates-card.jpg"
					srcset="/img/projects/solutions-manager/new-templates-card@2x.jpg 2x">
				<p>Participants were asked to look at the Templates page and describe what they saw. Qualitative results
					were a little mixed about this new layout, as 2/5 participants were still a little unsure what the
					nested list within each card was for at first. After a bit of exploration, they were able to
					understand the relationships better, but some more exploration around the visual layout or possibly
					adding a title to the nested list is needed.</p>
				<p>For showing the associations between Dashboards and Instances, the solution was addressed in the next
					objective.</p>
				<!--
					<p>Another problem I noticed from the previous release usability session was the user had a bit of trouble figuring out how to deploy an Instance from a Template. The original UI had a small icon of a rocket in each Template item that didn't look like a button and it wasn't immediately apparent what it actually would do.  I theorized that applying the Lumada primary button styles with descriptive text would increase discoverability and decrease time to task completion. (before/after images)</p>
					<p>I also felt that moving the deploy button into the area with the Instances would improve discoverability and provide the user a better association by proximity.</p>

				<h1>Objective 2: Navigation</h1>
				<h2>Existing problem:</h2>
				<p>There was no way for the user to easily navigate to associated components.</p>
				<h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
				<p>For linking between the Instances and the Dashboards, the GA release only supported a 1-1
					relationship for Instances, but a 1-Many relationship for the Dashboards. The fix for the Instances
					was easy: list the associated Dashboard in the card/list item as a link. The link would take the
					user to the Dashboards page, with the specific Dashboard applied as a search parameter.</p>
				<img src="/img/projects/solutions-manager/new-instance-card.png"
					srcset="/img/projects/solutions-manager/new-instance-card@2x.png 2x">
				<p>For the Dashboards linking, there was the potential for the list of Instances to be up to 13 items
					(the max recommended number of Instances per Dashboard based on performance benchmarking by the
					devs), which posed problems for the UI in both list and card views. My proposed solution for this
					was to display a badge with the number of associated Instances and an icon next to the number to
					indicate more info is available. In card view, the button would toggle an overlay on that card with
					a list of the Instances as links. In list view, the same badge would toggle a tooltip or popover
					with the same list of links.</p>
				<img src="/img/projects/solutions-manager/dashboard-instances-overlay.png"
					srcset="/img/projects/solutions-manager/dashboard-instances-overlay@2x.png 2x">
				<p>For this objective, participants were given a task which involved the assumption that their
					inventories were already populated with Templates, Instances and Dashboards.</p>
				<p>Participants were first instructed to navigate to the Instances page and then asked to navigate to
					the associated Dashboard for an Instance. All participants completed the task with no errors or
					confusion. The participants were then asked to identify all the associated Instances for that same
					Dashboard, then navigate to view those Instances. All participants were able to identify the badge
					as an interactive element within 3-5 seconds, click on it to view the Instances, then navigate to
					the Instances page from there.</p>
				<p>Since the previous design didn't have any linking between components, there was no baseline to test
					against. This navigation test can now be used as a baseline for measuring navigation improvements.
