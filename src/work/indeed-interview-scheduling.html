				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>At Indeed, the role of a UX Developer fell under the UX Org, along with Designers and Researchers.
					Each product team usually consisted of a Product Manager, a Technical Design Manager, a handful of
					Software Engineers, and an embedded UX Designer and Developer. As a UX Dev, it was my responsibility
					to collaborate with Designers and Product Managers, and implement the UI for product features, as
					well as communicate any updates and best practices to these teams, that fell under the Product Org.
				</p>
				<p>During my 5.5 years at Indeed, I worked on a handful of teams within the Employer side of the
					platform, the last one being the Interview Scheduling team, which owned a form that allowed an
					employer to send an invitation to a candidate for an interview. The form had a number of inputs that
					were imported React components from Indeed's design system library, which allowed the employer to
					specify duration, format, date, time and a few other options within the interview invitation. </p>

						<h1>Maintaining the UI with Storybook</h1>
						<p>I'm a strong ambassador for UI development tools, one of them being Storybook. As the UX
							Developer for this team, I was the person in charge of ensuring the UI/UX of this product
							feature looked and functioned as it should across all our supported devices. When I joined
							the team, they had Storybook set up for their product components, but they had grown a bit
							stale, and didnâ€™t represent all the various states that the components could display. I took
							it upon myself to audit the product in order to identify components that were missing,
							obsolete, or needed updating, such as arguments and parameters for altering the UI under
							certain conditions, for example, theming, translations, running interaction tests using the
							Storybook Play feature, and variables that controlled the UI for new experiments.</p>
						<p>I then created tickets in Jira for all these tasks and rallied the team to contribute to this
							improvement by explaining how other teams at Indeed could then easily preview and test our
							product to determine if it could be imported and surfaced within their respective products,
							therefore increasing the added value of our product.</p>
