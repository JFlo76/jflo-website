				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Hitachi is heavily investing in the IoT marketplace and the first step was to build Lumada, a
					platform for data visualization of industrial machinery.</p>
				<p>The main goal for the Alpha release included the ability to create and manage the digital
					representations of devices (Asset Avatars) that send data from sensors to the Lumada platform.</p>
				<p>My roles included designing and then building the UI for the software. Deliverables included
					sitemaps, userflows, wireframes, lo-fi prototypes, hi-rez comps, styleguide/pattern library, and
					production-ready code.</p>

				<h1>Onboarding from Green Fields</h1>
				<p>Based on preliminary info from the PMs and engineers, the process for creating new Asset Avatars was
					coupled to the creation of an Asset Type (classification of device; e.g. "truck” or “printer") and
					whether the device needed a gateway to connect to the platform. Because of this, I suggested the
					user would need some help for successful creation of their inventory.</p>
				<p>We contemplated doing inline help popups, but it still left a margin for error with the user. I
					recommended using a walkthrough approach, with sequential steps so the user would be encouraged to
					complete the critical first steps for populating their inventory.</p>
				<p>Later on, the engineers were able to remove some of the dependencies around these, so the UI changed
					to a self-guided type, where the user could choose what they wanted to create first. Since the user
					profiles for Alpha were going to be Hitachi engineers who would receive training on the product, we
					felt this was an appropriate decision.</p>

				<h1>Design Challenges</h1>
				<p>The first main challenge I faced was around the design strategy of the UI. The project managers had
					prioritized the targeted screen sizes for Alpha as 1) Desktop 2) Tablet 3) Phone.</p>
				<p>My recommendation was to take a mobile-first approach to avoid having to retrofit the UI later, but
					due to a compressed timeline and impending deadline they decided the project wouldn't allow for it.
				</p>
				<p>Having been in similar situations before, I knew how to design and build the UI in a way that would
					allow for easily adding the CSS for mobile. For my own reference, I had made a few wireframes for
					the mobile layout.</p>

				<img src="/img/projects/hitachi-desktop-mobile.png" class="project-image">

				<p>Another challenge I faced was around the Asset Data page, which needed to have the following
					features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Visualization of the device sensors, which are imported as a JSON file. This file structure, (or
						schema) is up to the user, so can potentially be a deeply nested tree.</li>
					<li>The ability to select each sensor within the tree structure for plotting the data into a graph.
					</li>
					<li>The ability for the user to toggle between real-time and historical data.</li>
					<li>The ability for the user to choose a period of time for historical data.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I did some research into how to best display a tree structure in a UI, including some D3.js options,
					but the devs were already committed to using Highcharts for their data visualization and adding
					another charting library was too expensive.</p>
				<p>The solution I decided on was a nested folder/file type UI that was wide enough to accommodate deeply
					nested items. This pattern is easy to understand and widely known, plus I knew the it could be built
					using nothing but HMTL and CSS.</p>

				<h1>Development Phase</h1>
				<p>My role during the development phase was to build out the UI using HTML, CSS and some light
					JavaScript using AngularJS in coordination with the front-end devs who were doing the heavy
					JavaScript work.</p>
				<p>In order to keep the code modular, we used SASS as a preprocessor for the CSS, adopted the BEM naming
					convention for our CSS classes, and a modified version of Atomic design for our overall design
					pattern hierarchy.</p>
				<p>I wanted to avoid using Bootstrap to save some kilobytes, but there were still components that we
					needed (such as date pickers and modals) so we added them as needed, a la carte. The engineers
					wanted to utilize Angular's UI Bootstrap, which has the Bootstrap components built out as Angular
					directives, which helped integrate them easily into the app.</p>
				<p>I also set up a pattern library using an automated style guide generator. This automates some of the
					build for the style guide and makes it easier to maintain and contribute to, because the markup is
					included within the file for each part of the UI and generated via Grunt/Gulp task runners.</p>

				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<p>Given the size of the team and the deadline imposed upon us, we put together a great Alpha
					application. In just over 4 months, we built out the foundation for Hitachi's new IoT platform,
					Lumada, and the stake holders were thrilled at what we accomplished.</p>
				<p>My team lead informed us that when he presented the application to the Hitachi CEO, he was quoted as
					saying, <span class="quotes">"This is the best time I've ever had in the U.S."</span></p>
